# home-for-stimulation

A visual tool which demonstrates the changes in temperature throughout this design of a Model Home for Stimulation. Temperature changes are based on the presence of people and their activity, the flow of air vertically and horizontally, and the building thermostatâ€™s built in responses. 

User controls:
- LEFT mouse click: adds a person (visually represented by a dot)
- RIGHT mouse click on a person: activate's the person's activity
- SHIFT + LEFT mouse click on a person: deletes the person

The architecture*:
- consists of pods 0-10 which are enclosed rooms
- and zones 1-9 (layed out in a 3x3 grid) which are the open spaces around the pods 
- pods 0-5 are on the first floor (first floor is displayed on the left)
- pods 6-10 are on the second floor (second floor is displayed on the right)
- pod 0 has an opening to pod 6 above it on the second floor
- pod 4 has an opening to pod 10 above it on the second floor
- pod 5 is entirely outdoors
- each pod links to all of the zones it's in with second floor pods linking to the zones below it
- and vise versa, each zone links to any pod that is in it
- tubes from pods 0 and 4 bring warm air to pod 5
- heat dispersion naturally occurs between zones as they are not physically divided by walls
- pods, on the other hand, contain the heat within themselves

This Model Home for Stimulation redefines how a thermostat works in order to create a level of discomfort which promotes activity. A typical thermostat constantly tries to keep the space at a comfortable temperature. In this architecture, we do the opposite. 

Rules of the Thermostat:
- If a pod is at a comfortable temperature for too long, the thermostat increases or decreases the temperature of its corresponding zone(s) 
- If a zone is at a comfortable temperature for too long, the thermostat increases or decreases the temperature of its corresponding pod(s) 
- If a pod is too hot, the thermostat decreases the temperature of its corresponding zone(s)
- If a zone is too hot, the thermostat decreases the temperature of its corresponding pod(s)
